# Panic! Lost In Demon Dungeon

This is a game I created for my self-guided final project at university. All assets used are original. The exported version may not work correctly, so if you're looking at this you may need to open it in the editor - though this may just be a problem with running the exe on Linux, since I made this before switching and didn't test it on any platforms but Windows. 

The goal is to find the exit. Click on things in the environment to interact with them. "Summoning Bones" allow you to create allies, while the attunig stones will allow you to access elemental moves. Combat is turn-based and happens in random encounters.

Despite not being very long, the central mechanics - though somewhat haphazardly implemented due to time constraints - were the product of a large amount of research into the dungeon crawling genre. The idea was to create a novel approach to the idea of "action-economy manipulation", meaning your ability to have more turns in which to act than the enemy, and vice-versa. The summoning bones creating disposable allies were what I came up with to enable this, as they provide the player with a resource to manage that gives them more actions than the enemy.
